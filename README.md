# NodeBot Workshop
Experimenting with the [Johnny-Five platform](http://johnny-five.io/) on the Arduino Uno. I was inspired to play around with the platform after attending [Conf & Coffee 2018](https://www.meetup.com/codecoffeeyvr/). All the [NodeBot Workshop](https://github.com/tableflip/nodebot-workshop) exercises have been completed.
